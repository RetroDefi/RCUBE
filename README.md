# RCUBE
Dynamic Supply Protocol
A Sustainable Deflationary Rebase Protocol

R-CUBE combines the best deflationary and dynamic supply mechanisms to ensure a constant reward to all  holders

R-CUBE  runs in cycles . On every cycle, the Burn Rate is increased in 1% increments for each 500,000 Tokens transacted  until 6.5%  Burn Rate  is  reached.  After  2,500,000 traded tokens it  will  reset  to  the  initial  rate.  

After the end of each cycle a rebase will be called which rebases 25% of the burned tokens during the previous cycle to holders wallets.
